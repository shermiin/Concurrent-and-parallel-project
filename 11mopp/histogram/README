Problem D
Color Histogram

In image processing and photography, a color histogram is a representation of the
distribution of colors in an image. For digital images, a color histogram represents the
number of pixels that have colors in each of a fixed list of color ranges, that span the
image's color space, the set of all possible colors. 2
Create a parallel version of an algorithm that generates a color histogram of a digital
image.

Input

The input image is a text file using PPM format 3 . The image resolution is up to 4k.
The input must be read from the standard input.

Output

The output contains 64 numbers representing the mean of pixel used in the digital
image. Each number is a floating point number with 3 decimal places.
The output must be written to the standard output.
